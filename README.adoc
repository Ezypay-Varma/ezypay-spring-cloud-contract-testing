= Spring Cloud Contract samples

This repository contains the consumer and the producer applications to use with Spring Cloud Contract
project.

It contains one main `master` branch where we test against the latest versions of
Spring Cloud Contract.

This repository shows examples of

- storing contracts on the producer side

Can also be done on following ways (Ref to advanced section at the bottom)

- storing producer contracts on consumer side and vice versa
- storing contracts on remote artifact manager like (Nexus)
- storing contracts in a common repo
- passing stubs via Rest docs

Both for REST and Messaging. Built with Maven.

Required Java 8 and Maven to be installed locally.

== Projects

=== Producer

The producer application contains contracts for both REST and messaging
communication. From these contracts tests and stubs will be generated.

The producer in the contract also uses features like usage of common libraries, different
combination of dynamic properties.

It also uses scenario based contracts. That means that the produced stubs are stateful.

=== Consumer

The consumer application is using the stubs of the producer for both
rest and messaging.

It also contains the consumer side of the stateful scenario case. By calling the same endpoint a couple
 of times we get different responses due to changing state.

== How to build it?

=== Windows

You can run Maven from the root folder of producer project to create ans install stubs. So from a clean checkout:

[source,bash]
----
.\mvnw clean install -Ptest
----

Once installed run below command to run all tests(auto generated tests and your tests)

[source,bash]
----
.\mvnw clean install
----

=== Mac/Linux

You can run Maven from the root folder of producer project to create ans install stubs. So from a clean checkout:

[source,bash]
----
./mvnw clean install -Ptest
----

Once installed run below command to run all tests(auto generated tests and your tests)

[source,bash]
----
./mvnw clean install
----

The order should be as follows

- producer
- consumer
